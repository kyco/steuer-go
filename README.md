## How it works

SteuerGo connects to the official BMF API to calculate taxes based on the provided income and tax class. The API returns detailed tax information which is then formatted and displayed in a user-friendly way.

The application is built using:
- [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea): A powerful TUI framework
- [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss): For terminal styling
- Go's XML package: For parsing the BMF API responses
